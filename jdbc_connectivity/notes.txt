We have different types of databases : oracle , mysql , postgres , db2 (RDBMS)
mongoDb , cassandra

JDBC : java database connectivity
When we want to connect java with any of the databases we need driver.It acts as a bridge between the java prohram and database 
We have 4 types of JDBC drivers
1)JDBC-ODBC bridge (legacy , not recommended). Latest java versions do not support odbc
2)Native-api driver : This driver convers JDBC calls into database specific native calls 
3)Network protocol driver : This is cloud solution . This is database independent. (requires middleware)
4)Thin driver : Thin driver (most popular , no native library required)

Note : When selecting the JDBC driver , consider factors such as peformance requirements , databse compatibility , easy of deployment

-----------
7 steps for jdbc connection : 
1)import package (java.sql.*)
2)load driver + register
Class.forName()
3)Establish connection
Connection con = new DriverManager.getConnection()
4)create statement
statement = con.createStatement()
5)execute query
ResultSet rs = st.executeQuery("") | st.executeUpdate()
6)Process the ResultSet
rs.next() : To go to nest row
rs.getString(<column_number>) , rs.getInt(<column_number>)
7)close the connection
st.close();
con.close();
